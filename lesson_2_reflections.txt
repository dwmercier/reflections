What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository its contents are tracked by version control. This doesn't actually create an initial commit however, you still need to do the first commit yourself.
If you don't initialize a repository, its contents are no different than that of a normal directory - nothing will be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is where the repository's files are. The staging area is where you decide what to do with the files in the working directory before you make a commit.
The staging area allows you to make decisions before you finalize them - you can make decisions one file at a time before you go ahead and commit.
